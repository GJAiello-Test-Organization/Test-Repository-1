This is the first line of my poem.
There are many poems like mine, but this one is mine.
DOG!
PONIES!
I'm making this edit on a NEW BRANCH!!
UNIDORN!!
Roses are red,
violets are blue,
THIS IS AN EDIT TO THE POEM!
it's never made sense to me,
to say violets are blue.
This edit was made on the MASTER BRANCH!
